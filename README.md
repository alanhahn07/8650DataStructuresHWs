# 8650DataStructuresHWs
This is a repository for holding my Math 8650 Graduate Data Structures Homeworks. The class was generally about data structures and in particular about data structures in Python. The version of Python used in the class was a version of Python 2.

There are a couple of things to note about the contents of this repository: 

1. This repository is somewhat being worked on. The code was originally written in a version of Python 2, and so sometimes things don't work when they should, depending on what version of Python you are using as your Jupyter Notebook kernel. Running with a Python 3 kernel, most things should work until around the 5th HW until the differences between the two Python versions become too great for Python 3 to parse. 

2. These are my homeworks essentially as-is. There might be some extra packages you need on your machine in order to e.g. see certain graphs. For example, one of the homeworks uses NetworkX. Another point to go along with this is that there may be typos, functions that could be better written, etc. throughout the hws. 

I suggest using this repository to get an idea of what the class was about, and get an idea of my programming level. If you see any egregious errors that you think I should know about, you are welcome to comment.
